    "Ans \n",
    "\n",
    "Web API is a specific type of API that is designed to be accessible over the internet using standard web protocols like HTTP. Web APIs are typically used for data exchange and interaction between a client application (such as a web application or mobile app) and a server. They allow for the retrieval of data, the execution of specific operations, or the exchange of information using HTTP requests. Web APIs are often used for building web services and facilitating communication between web applications and external systems.\n",

    "API is a more general term encompassing various methods of software communication, Web API is a specialized type of API used for internet-based communication, particularly over the HTTP protocol. Web APIs are commonly used in web development for accessing and exchanging data with remote services or servers."
